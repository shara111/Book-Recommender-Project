# Semantic Book Recommender with AI


* Text data cleaning (code in the notebook `data-exploration.ipynb`)
* Semantic (vector) search and how to build a vector database (code in the notebook `vector-search.ipynb`). This allows users to find the most similar books to a natural language query (e.g., "a book about a person seeking revenge").
* Doing text classification using zero-shot classification in LLMs (code in the notebook `text-classification.ipynb`). This allows us to classify the books as "fiction" or "non-fiction", creating a facet that users can filter the books on. 
* Doing sentiment analysis using LLMs and extracting the emotions from text (code in the notebook `sentiment-analysis.ipynb`). This will allow users to sort books by their tone, such as how suspenseful, joyful or sad the books are.
* Creating a web application using Gradio for users to get book recommendations (code in the file `gradio-dashboard.py`).

In order to create your vector database, you'll need to create a .env file in your root directory containing your OpenAI API key. 

The data for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle.
